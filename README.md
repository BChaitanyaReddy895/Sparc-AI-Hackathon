# Sparc-AI-Hackathon
As a part of the Sparc AI Hackathon, as a team of 4 we had developed Resume based internship matching system using Machine Learning(ML).We are using the ML libraries such as NLTK for data preprocessing, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes model for classifying and matching the internships with the resumes.
Technology used: Machine Learning(ML).
ML Libraries used:Pandas for data manipulation, NLTK for data preprocessing , Scikit-learn for selecting and evaluating machine learning models(Logistic Regression), numpy for handling numeric data and openPyxl for reading excel files.
Programming Language used:Python
